# Home-Cyber-Lab-IT-Troubleshooting
This home lab uses Windows 10 and Ubuntu 24.04 to practice IT troubleshooting, system diagnostics, and basic network analysis. It includes VM setup, DNS troubleshooting, ICMP testing, and full documentation. I built a small IT lab in VirtualBox to learn and practice real entry-level troubleshooting tasks. The project helped me get comfortable with basic troubleshooting, networking commands, and system diagnostics across both Windows and Linux.
